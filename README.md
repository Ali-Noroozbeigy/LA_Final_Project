# Linear algebra Final Project
This project has two parts:

### Part 1
This part of the project provides a solution for the game lights out by solving linear boolean equation correspond to the pattern of game. 1s in pattern show those squares are on and 0s show those are off. at last after computing, a list will be returned which tells by clicking on what squares, all the squares will be off respectively.
### Part 2
This part provides Histogram-matching algorithm with source and reference images.
